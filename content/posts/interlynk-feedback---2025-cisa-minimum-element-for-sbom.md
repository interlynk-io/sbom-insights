## Executive Summary

[Interlynk](https://interlynk.io/) appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on CISA's proposed "2025 Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)." As developers of open-source SBOM quality and management tools, we bring a unique perspective grounded in practical implementation experience across diverse enterprise environments.

Through our work on **[sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs)** (SBOM Quality Score) and **[sbomasm](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomasm)** (SBOM Assembler), we have analyzed thousands of SBOMs from various industries and toolchains, giving us deep insights into the real-world challenges of SBOM creation, validation, and consumption. Our tools help organizations assess SBOM completeness, manage multi-format SBOMs, and ensure compliance with evolving standards—experience that directly informs our response to these proposed minimum elements.

We commend CISA for its iterative approach to refining SBOM requirements. However, we have identified several areas where clarification or adjustment would significantly improve adoption and implementation success. Our recommendations focus on balancing comprehensive security requirements with practical feasibility, ensuring that the minimum elements drive meaningful improvements in software supply chain transparency without creating insurmountable barriers for software producers and consumers alike.
