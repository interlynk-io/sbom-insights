## Getting Started

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the PaperMod theme. To contribute, you'll need:

1. Git for version control
2. Hugo (optional for local preview)
3. A text editor for writing Markdown

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbom-insights.git
cd sbom-insights

# Initialize submodules (PaperMod theme) - already done
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Hugo (optional, for local preview)
# On macOS
brew install hugo

# On Ubuntu/Debian
snap install hugo

# On Windows
choco install hugo-extended
```

### Using the Makefile

We provide a Makefile with helpful automation commands:

```bash
# View all available commands
make help
```

#### Available Makefile Commands

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `make help` | Display all available commands | `make help` |
| `make serve` | Run Hugo development server with drafts on http://localhost:1313 | `make serve` |
| `make build` | Build production site with minification | `make build` |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts (public/ and resources/) | `make clean` |
| `make new-post` | Create a new blog post with automatic filename formatting | `make new-post TITLE="Your Post Title"` |
| `make deploy` | Build and deploy to Netlify production | `make deploy` |
| `make preview` | Deploy a preview to Netlify | `make preview` |
| `make update-theme` | Update PaperMod theme to latest version | `make update-theme` |
| `make check-links` | Check for broken links in built site (requires htmltest) | `make check-links` |
| `make format` | Format all markdown files with prettier | `make format` |

#### Quick Examples

```bash
# Start writing a new post
make new-post TITLE="Understanding SBOM Formats"
make serve  # Preview at http://localhost:1313

# Ready to submit?
make format  # Clean up formatting
make check-links  # Verify all links work
make build  # Final build check

# Deploy (for maintainers)
make preview  # Test deployment
make deploy  # Production deployment
```

## Adding a New Post

### Step 1: Create a New Post File

Create a new Markdown file in the `content/posts/` directory:

```bash
# Using Hugo (recommended)
hugo new posts/your-post-title.md

# Or manually create the file
touch content/posts/your-post-title.md
```

### Step 2: Add Front Matter

Every post needs front matter at the top. Here's the template:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
draft = false
description = "A brief description of your post (150-160 characters for SEO)"
author = "Your Name"
tags = ["SBOM", "Security", "Supply Chain"]
categories = ["Best Practices"]
toc = true
tocopen = false
weight = 1
cover = {
    image = "/images/your-cover-image.jpg",
    alt = "Cover image description",
    caption = "Image caption if needed",
    relative = false
}
+++
```

#### Front Matter Fields Explained:

- **title**: The title of your post
- **date**: Publication date (ISO 8601 format)
- **draft**: Set to `true` while writing, `false` when ready to publish
- **description**: SEO meta description (150-160 characters)
- **author**: Your name (should match author data file)
- **tags**: Relevant keywords (lowercase, use existing tags when possible)
- **categories**: Main category (check existing categories first)
- **toc**: Show table of contents (true/false)
- **tocopen**: Open TOC by default (true/false)
- **weight**: Post priority (lower numbers appear first)
- **cover**: Optional cover image configuration

### Step 3: Write Your Content

After the front matter, write your post in Markdown:

````markdown
## Introduction

Start with a compelling introduction...

## Main Content

### Subsection 1

Your content here...

### Subsection 2

More content...

## Code Examples

\```json
{
"example": "code block"
}
\```

## Conclusion

Wrap up your post...
````

### Best Practices for Posts:

- Use clear, descriptive headings (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include code examples where relevant
- Add images to the `/static/images/` directory
- Link to authoritative sources
- Keep paragraphs concise (3-5 sentences)
- Use lists for better readability

## Adding Author Information

### Step 1: Create Author Data File

Create a YAML file in `data/authors/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p data/authors
touch data/authors/your-name.yaml
```

### Step 2: Add Author Details

```yaml
name: "Your Full Name"
bio: "Brief bio about yourself and your expertise in SBOM/security"
email: "your.email@example.com"
company: "Your Company Name"
github: "yourusername"
linkedin: "yourusername"
twitter: "yourusername"
website: "https://yourwebsite.com"
copyright: "Â© 2025 Your Name"  # Optional: custom copyright for your posts
```

### Step 3: Add Your Photo

Place your avatar image in `/static/images/authors/`:

```bash
cp your-photo.jpg static/images/authors/
```

Image requirements:

- Format: JPEG or PNG
- Size: 400x400px (square)
- File size: Under 100KB

## Categories and Tags

### Existing Categories

Use these primary categories for your posts:

- **Best Practices**: Implementation guides and recommendations
- **Tools & Reviews**: SBOM tool comparisons and reviews
- **Standards**: Information about SPDX, CycloneDX, etc.
- **Industry News**: Updates, regulations, and announcements
- **Case Studies**: Real-world implementations
- **Security**: Supply chain security topics

hugo server -D

# Without drafts

# The site will be available at http://localhost:1313
```

### Building the Site

```bash
# Build the static site (using Makefile)
make build

# The built site will be in the public/ directory
```
